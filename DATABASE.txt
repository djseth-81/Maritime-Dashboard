### Tables and what I expect each processor to do when manipulating DB entities
- EVENTS
    id, src_id, timestamp, effective, end, expires, active, type, description, instructions, urgency, severity, 
    - noaa event
        - type = "{category}-{messageType}"
        - Do I track replacement time/Replacement ID?
    - issued by vessels 
        - src_id = vessels.mmsi
        - some report start/stop fishing, useful to update vessel.current_status
    - issued by sources (stations)
        - src_id = sources.id

- SOURCES
    - ID is unique
    - Can be API
        - ID auto generated if not applied
        - type = "API"
        - geom = NULL
        - timezone = NULL
        - datum = API keys (Add datums column)
    - Can be Station
        - ID = reported zone ID
        - type != "API"
        - geom NOT NULL
        - timezone NOT NULL
        - datums = APIs/details it reports (what met data, ocean data, events, etc)
    - refer to disseminate Met, Oce, Events

- ZONES
    id, geom, region, name, type, src_id

- METEOROLOGY/OCEANOGRAPHY
    id, src_id, lat, lon, temp, humidity, wind_speed, wind_heading, percipitation, forecast, timestamp, geom, event_id, region
    - geometry: WHY? What about storing zone_id instead?
    - event_id: Why try and associate an event with report?
    - Met.forecast: Should I provide instantaneous hourly forecast, and then just update every hour, or should I provide an array of forecast and then update that every hour?

### How I expect interactions with DB to go
- selecting a ship/double-click on location
    - bring up meteorology
        - use zone.id = met.zone_id to relevant met, OR zone src_id pull new met from API
    - bring up oceanography
        - use zone.id = oce.zone_id to filter most recent oce, OR zone src_id pull new oce from API
    - bring up events
        - use zone.src_id to filter for events, OR pull new ones with zone.id
        - use vessels.mmsi for all ships in [proximity] of point to filter with events
- Selecting zone
    - met and ocean works the same
    - retrieves all vessels within zone
        - retrieves all events that have a src.id = vessel.mmsi
